This repository is a collection of functions that mimic the behavior of the real standard library functions in C.
The functions compile into a library using the makefile. The binary could later be used in future projects in C.
There are 2 different rules in the makefile, make compiles group one functions that were done for the mandatory
part of this project and bonus compiles the bonus functions.
